# 1 Introduction

During our last lab we created tests for the Range and DataUtilities classes. This lab built on the last lab by requiring us to check coverage of these tests. With our new knowledge of how to cover more branches, conditions, and statement we created more tests to improve the code coverage. We were able to check our progress by using ECLEmma.  

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Requirements-based testing is easier to plan/carry out than coverage-based testing. This is because you only have to know what the expected output is and not how the function being tested operates. However, this does mean that requirements-based testing may not test the function completely. This is where it is advantageous to use coverage-based testing since you will ensure that every possibly test type is used.
